# Onomy Testnets

After going through several iterations of private testnets, we are excited to welcome validator networks interested in joining our public testnet for the Onomy Network (ONET).

The ONET is a Cosmos Tendermint-based Proof of Stake (PoS) layer-1 blockchain network which powers the Onomy Exchange and the Onomy Reserve. First and foremost, our native stablecoins and NOM tokens will be natively tradeable on the ONET, but cross-chain integrations through bi-directional bridges are already underway, including any Cosmos-enabled and EVM-based chains, as well as Polkadot, Cardano, Avalanche, Solana, and others.

For the first iteration of our testnet, our primary objectives are to successfully test the Onomy Network, the Onomy — ETH bridge, and conduct a public test of the Bonding Curve platform.

## **Call for Validators** <a href="#45ad" id="45ad"></a>

Validators joining our first public testnet are encouraged to report findings and share feedback, in preparation for the ONET’s mainnet launch. This testnet is also focused on proving out the Gravity bridge as well as deployment methodology and other custom modules for the upcoming production ONET.

## **How to Join the Testnet** <a href="#b6cb" id="b6cb"></a>

For testnet documentation and joining guides, kindly head over to Onomy's [GitHub testnet repo](https://github.com/onomyprotocol/onomy/tree/dev/docs/testnet), where you can find details on:

## **Understanding NOM, the Proof of Stake Token** <a href="#3008" id="3008"></a>

NOM serves as the single collateral to Onomy's fiat-pegged stablecoins and is the go-to token for PoS staking, while granting governance rights and rewarding those who support the network.
