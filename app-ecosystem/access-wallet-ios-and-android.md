### Security

Developed by contributors to the Onoym DAO, Access Mobile Wallet is self-custodial - meaning nobody can control your wallet without access to your device because all of your walletâ€™s information is stored locally on your device and protected by OS provided biometrics. This also means that all management is done by the user.\
\
Your recovery phrase, private keys, and even public addresses are unknown to the app developer - giving you full control and privacy. Significant technical achievements have enabled Access Wallet to separate key management from the JS engine. Audits done by NCC Group.
