### Status

Onomy's Access Wallet is currently in private preview, deployed on TestFlight for iOS. Access Wallet will also be made available for Android users.&#x20;

### Security

Onomy cannot view, access, or control your wallet in any way because all of your walletâ€™s information is stored locally on your device and protected by OS provided biometrics. Your recovery phrase, private keys, and even public addresses are unknown to Onomy - giving you full control and privacy. Significant technical achievements have enabled Access Wallet to separate key management from the JS engine. Audits done by NCC Group.
