# Onomy Exchange (ONEX)

The Onomy Exchange (ONEX) is a cross-chain and multi-chain hybrid decentralized exchange (DEX), with a technical architecture that converges Automated Market Maker (AMM) liquidity pools with an orderbook UI, thus creating a powerful, fair, and non-custodial approach to decentralized trading that supports stop losses, limit orders, conditional orders and advanced charting.

### Decentralized Exchange

No management is required for the exchange, as it is deployed on-chain. It is a decentralized exchange without the need for central management, nor the DAO to manage it as well. The exchange is self-sustaining with user-driven liquidity. Listings are permissionless.

While not required for the operation of the DEX, any updates or feature additions to the exchange code must be passed by a DAO governance proposal and a chain upgrade conducted by the validator set.

### User Interface

While the exchange is decentralized and can be interacted with on-chain, various user interfaces may be deployed to assist the interaction with the exchange. \

An Onomy DAO supported interface is hosted at [app.onomy.io](https://app.onomy.io). The Onomy DAO may vote to fund a proposal made by any contributor to build user interfaces, additional features, and tooling.
