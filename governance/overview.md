# Overview

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central governing entity. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles.

Onomy will be governed by the Onomy DAO**, providing NOM holders with the opportunity to guide the decision-making process through NOM-weighed votes**.&#x20;

The Onomy Governance module leverages the pre-built module of the Cosmos SDK, with a few changes enacted to allow for on-chain treasury management. The on-chain governance system allows $NOM token holders to submit and vote on proposals changing the parameters and functionality of the Onomy ecosystem, as well as funding proposals initiated by the community or enterprises to improve Onomy via the on-chain Treasury.\
\
Features of governance include:

* **Submit Proposals:** Any holder of $NOM can submit a proposal as long as they put up the minimum deposit of 500 $NOM. Once submitted, it automatically enters the voting period.
* **Voting:** Delegators and validators who stake the governance coin $NOM are welcome to vote on any and all proposals that are currently running (has reached MinDeposit) with ‘yes’, ‘no’, and ‘no with veto’.&#x20;
* **Inheritance and penalties:** Delegators inherit their validator's vote if they don't vote themselves.
* **Claiming deposit:** Users that deposited on proposals can recover their deposits if the proposal was accepted OR if the proposal never entered voting period.
* **Treasury Management:** NOM Holders vote on usage of Onomy Protocol's treasury of funds.
