# Overview

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central governing entity. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles.

Onomy will be governed by the Onomy DAO**, providing NOM holders with the opportunity to guide the decision-making process through NOM-weighed votes**. \
\
Features of governance include:

* **Proposal submission:** Users can submit proposals with a deposit. Once the minimum deposit is reached, proposal enters voting period
* **Vote:** Participants can vote on proposals that reached MinDeposit
* **Inheritance and penalties:** Delegators inherit their validator's vote if they don't vote themselves.
* **Claiming deposit:** Users that deposited on proposals can recover their deposits if the proposal was accepted OR if the proposal never entered voting period.
* **Treasury Management:** NOM Holders vote on usage of Onomy Protocol's treasury of funds.
