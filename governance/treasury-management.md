# Treasury Management

### **Treasury Management**

DAO-governance of Onomy Protocol includes governance of the Onomy Treasury of Funds, whereby funds are outside of the control of any central entity. Funds may only be accessed through a successful proposal passed by the Onomy DAO. \
\
Therefore, Onomy Protocol will integrate a DAO Treasury Wallet into Governance such that proposals requesting funds must note an amount of funds requested alongside a recipient address. Funding proposals must pass successfully for the funds requested to be released from the DAO Treasury Wallet in an autonomous fashion.
