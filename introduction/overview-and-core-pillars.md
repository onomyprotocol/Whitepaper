# Overview & Core Pillars

Onomy Protocol is a **layer-1 Cosmos-based blockchain network** powering a **cross-chain and hybrid decentralized exchange (DEX)** and **a stablecoin issuance system** through which users may **easily mint, trade, and lend stable representations of national currencies called Denoms**.&#x20;

Additional products and services, as detailed below, add significant functionality and exposure to liquidity. By merging blockchain technology with traditional finance and providing the fundamental infrastructure for the inclusion of these markets in the digital asset economy, Onomy achieves accessibility otherwise not possible. Furthermore, **Onomyâ€™s core goal is to provide a singular platform from which market participants can enter and exit all digital asset ecosystems**.&#x20;

## Onomy Core Pillars

Onomy consists of four pillars designed to be a self-governed monetary stabilization system.

* **Onomy Network (ONET):** A decentralized peer-to-peer computational network that processes transactions submitted by users and rewards operators in ONET's native protocol coin NOM. &#x20;
* **Onomy Reserve (ORES):** governs minting of decentralized stablecoins called Denoms, utilizing NOM as collateral.
* **Onomy Exchange (ONEX):** a base-layer decentralized exchange that is used by Onomy participants to trade native cryptocurrencies, Denoms, and NOM across prominent blockchain economies.&#x20;
* **Onomy Access**: A cross-chain wallet allowing users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies cross-chain, within a single interface that does not impose use various wallets or browser extentions to access the DeFi realm

## Functionalities

The** Onomy Network **is a Layer 1 blockchain network built on the Cosmos Ecosystem. Cosmos is based on the Tendermint protocol, backed by the IBC framework. Tendermint is the first working proof-of-stake consensus protocol while IBC allows for cross-chain functionality between Cosmos blockchains. **Interoperability is further enhanced with bi-directional bridges** to prominent blockchain networks outside of the Cosmos ecosystem, like Ethereum, Avalanche, Near, Cardano, EVM chains, and others to be announced.&#x20;

The** native variable asset of the Onomy Protocol is $NOM.** $NOM is used to secure the network through staking and as collateral for the minting of Denoms through the Onomy Reserve (ORES). The Onomy Decentralized Exchange (ONEX) provides Automatic Market Making price discovery used to rebalance collateral ratios of ORES minting accounts.&#x20;

Onomy Protocol will **incentivize $NOM staking with a dual regime inflationary schedule**. The initial hyperbolic hyper-inflationary period, with a peak reward of 100% ARR inflation, is designed to drive network participants to stake and secure the network. Staked $NOM will also receive transaction fees from both the ONEX and the associated bridge liquidity pools.&#x20;

Denom supply in the market is determined by** ORES minting and burning as well as staking with validators**. Denom minters are incentivized to deposit $NOM in ORES accounts by negative interest rates. Delegators, those participants that delegate or bond $NOM and Denoms with validators, are incentivized to delegate their Denoms to validators to receive an inflationary reward. Inflationary rewards at validators, both for $NOM and Denoms, are controlled by the percentage of all coins staked with validators. This control variable is decided by a vote of $NOM holders and directly effects supply within the market. The inflation rate is a dependent of the control variable and fluctuates to incentivize staking, minting or burning of Denoms to balance the monetary system.&#x20;

Lastly, **Onomy Protocol will be governed as a decentralized autonomous organization, providing $NOM holders with the opportunity to guide the decision-making process through $NOM-weighed votes**. By combining these fundamentals, Onomy Protocol fosters the realization of a financial framework that bridges traditional markets with the digital asset economy, where individuals and institutions worldwide may seamlessly utilize Denoms to access efficient and secure Forex transactional capabilities that occur on a cross-border railway with instantaneous settlement.

Onomy has also developed Equity, a new consensus algorithm that will provide the required transaction throughput as well as leaderless ordering, addressing validator front running.&#x20;
