# Onomy Settlement & Pillars

We propose addressing forex settlement risk and market fragmentation issues \(Schrimpf & Sushko, 2019\) through Onomy, a decentralized protocol that virtualizes major currencies around the world and provides for near-instantaneous settlement. Recent advances in decentralized protocols and proven implementations of a new class of virtual assets named stablecoins have made this possible.

Onomy consists of three pillars designed to be a self-governed monetary stabilization system.

* **Onomy Network \(ONET\):** A decentralized peer-to-peer computational network that processes transactions submitted by users and rewards operators in ONET's native protocol coin NOM.  
* **Onomy Reserve \(ORES\):** governs minting of stabilized virtual currencies, called Denoms, utilizing NOM as collateral.
* **Onomy Exchange \(ONEX\):** a base-layer decentralized exchange that is used by Onomy participants to trade NOM and Denoms. ONEX is integrated with ORES to handle reserve accounts' maintanence and rebalance collateral ratios.
