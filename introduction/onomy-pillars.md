# Onomy Settlement & Pillars

We propose addressing Forex settlement risk and market fragmentation issues \(Schrimpf & Sushko, 2019\) through Onomy, a decentralized protocol that virtualizes major currencies around the world and provides for near-instantaneous settlement. Recent advances in decentralized protocols and proven implementations of a new class of virtual-assets named stable-coins have made this possible.

Onomy consists of three pillars designed to be a self-governed monetary stabilization system.

* **ONET:** A decentralized peer-to-peer computational network that processes transactions submitted by users and rewards operators in 'ONET's native protocol coin NOM.  
* **ORES:** governs minting of stabilized virtual currencies, called Denoms, utilizing NOM as collateral.
* **ONEX:** a base-layer decentralized exchange that is used by Onomy participants to trade NOM and Denoms. ONEX is integrated with ORES to handle reserve accounts' liquidations and rebalance collateral ratios during times of distress.
