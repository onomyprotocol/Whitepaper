# Hawala

The first coins appeared in 600 B.C. created by Kin Alyattes in Lydia and the first paper money was introduced by the Chinese Tang Dynasty which ruled from 618 – 907 A.D. China had already gone through a financial crisis due to inflation and outlawed paper money entirely in 1455 A.D. before the western world had even had a taste of the financial instrument. Even though coins and paper money have significant utility within the economy they are limited to the jurisdiction of the issuing body. Therefore, other forms of remittance were formed to aid traders of foreign goods.

There are and continue to this to be forms of foreign remittance that pre-date and work along-side today’s formal banking and cross-country payment systems. The Tang Dynasty had a system to transfer funds named the fei-ch’ien \(flying money\). Also, by some accounts, the “hawala” system has existed since the 8th century as a vast network of money brokers that originated in India to serve Muslim, Arabic and Indian traders along the Silk Road and continues to operate today. Hawala is built on a network of trust and relationships between money tradesmen called hawalandars. These hawalandars are usually large distances from each other and rely on their counterparts to execute either simple or complex reverse informal hawala transactions to settle their positions. \(World Bank and IMF, 2003\)
