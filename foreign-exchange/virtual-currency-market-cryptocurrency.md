# Virtual Currency Market \(Cryptocurrency\)

There are many similarities between FOREX and virtual currency markets. The most obvious is that both markets are based on “currencies,” while some may not agree that they are not equivalent. In addition, both markets are decentralized by nature with complex structures. Lastly, many virtual currencies not only emulate fiat currency in their utility, but also have digital and social economies that have effects on the pricing like those of fiat currencies.

While the Forex markets have been maturing since the 1970’s, virtual currencies have only been in existence since 2009. Their origin and rise to prominence have been purely through trading with very little use outside of the financial markets themselves. As such, the value of virtual currencies has been primarily speculative in nature based on the short and long term investment as well as volatility trading.

The traditional on and off ramps from the fiat currencies to the virtual world have been either through retail aggregators, in the form of “cryptocurrency exchanges”, as well as OTC trades and brokers. Until recently, regulation has stopped banks from participating, but that has started to change with many banks setting up trading desks as well as accepting deposits. This opens up the doors to dual purpose banks that act as dealers in the Forex markets as well as dealers in virtual currencies.

While foreign currency markets are separated into Inter-dealer and customer service networks, virtual currencies are separated into fiat and virtual domains. Virtual currencies only exist within the virtual domain while fiat currencies flow primarily between three different actors; retail aggregators, OTC dealers and more recently bank platforms. Retail aggregators consists of virtual currency exchanges where retail trades take place while larger trade take place through OTC desks where there is concern that slippage may occur within illiquid markets. Bank platforms are emerging as regulators begin to authorize the first “crypto-banks” to be licensed.

Within the virtual domain flows are are highly interconnected between all parties with permissionless access to decentralized exchanges as well as other platforms. The network effects created by this interconnectedness is the primary advantage. Volatility, regulations, lack of infrastructure and limited on-ramps from fiat currency are restricting virtual currencies from use as main stream payment vehicle. The primary on-ramps are through retail aggregators as well as over the counter desks at those same retail aggregators.
