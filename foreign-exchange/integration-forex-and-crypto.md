# Integration \(Forex & Crypto\)

Stable-coin integration into Forex markets relies on the fiat interfaces within the cryptocurrency market to provide liquidity. The customer demand will come internally within the highly connected virtual domain where the main driver for adoption is is the need for less volatile instruments for value storage as well as ability to derive arbitrage opportunities. The secondary demand will be from Forex participants looking for on ramps into crypto from different denominations of fiat. These transactions will go through retail and OTC desks handling both forex and virtual currencies. Retail aggregators hosting virtual currency exchange platforms are also the leading virtual currency over the counter dealers.
