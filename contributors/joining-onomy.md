# Joining Onomy

As a rapidly-expanding open source initiative, Onomy Protocol is open to all individuals and/or entities to get involved with the development of the Onomy Ecosystem.

You are thereby invited to contribute in any means possible to Onomy's public GitHub repos, either by improving existing functions, providing feedback, solving bugs, or coding entirely new features. \
\
You may also submit a funding proposal to the Onomy DAO to receive funding for your initiative.
