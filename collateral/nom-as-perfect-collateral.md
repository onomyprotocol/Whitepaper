Lastly, the Denoms are not only collateralized by NOM, but are also a vessel of collateralization of NOM. As mentioned before, the flows of currencies determine the exchange rate or value of a currency in terms of other currencies. The exchange rate, determined by the currency flows, is then in essence the evidence of a form of market collateralization. The ability for a currency to be exchanged for another is what backs fiat currencies not tied to gold as well as volatile cryptocurrencies that have no other underlying collateral. Therefore, if a Denom is stabilized with its counterpart fiat currency then itself becomes collateralized by the market. Thus the NOM itself is collateralized by the Denoms it has the ability to mint. As the Denoms market capitalization grows, whilst being stabilized with their fiat counterparts, the NOM is itself collateralized by the market as well while serving as the collateral for the market.
