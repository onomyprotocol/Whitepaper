# Testnet Guide

The following tutorial will guide you through Onomy’s testnet-based Bonding Curve interface, enabling interested parties to interact with the beta versions of the Onomy Network, Arc Bridge Hub, and BCO.

## What’s the Onomy BCO?&#x20;

The Bonding Curve Offering (BCO) helps distribute NOM tokens to users who would like to utilize Onomy’s vertically-integrated ecosystem of DeFi products.&#x20;

Bonding Curves work by establishing a relationship between supply and price through AMM contracts. They provide an instant market with liquidity before exchange listings, rather than a static-priced sale.&#x20;

The BCO is deployed on Ethereum, where $bNOM may be purchased and sold. $bNOM may then be bridged 1:1 for $NOM on the Onomy Network, which burns the $bNOM and moves the price floor higher until it reaches parity with $ETH. $NOM would be listed on exchanges and is the utility & governance token for the Onomy ecosystem.

## How to Use Onomy’s Testnet Bonding Curve?

### 1) Install Metamask and the Keplr wallets

As Onomy’s BCO is a non-custodial and decentralized platform, you’ll need to connect your ERC-20 and Cosmos-compatible wallets to the contract.&#x20;

We recommend using Metamask to access the Ethereum Goerli testnet and Keplr to access the Onomy Network testnet.&#x20;

You can download Metamask here:&#x20;
