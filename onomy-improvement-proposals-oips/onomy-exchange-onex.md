The **Onomy Exchange (ONEX)** is a cross-chain and multi-chain hybrid decentralized exchange (DEX), with a technical architecture that converges Automated Market Maker (AMM) liquidity pools with an orderbook UI, thus creating a powerful, fair, and non-custodial approach to trading that supports stop losses, limit orders, conditional orders and advanced charting. It's the CEX experience, on-chain.
