# ONEX

The Onomy Exchange \(ONEX\) bridges the gap between the largest market in the world, foreign currency exchange, and the realm of virtual currencies. Some would argue that all currencies are now digital, and this is for the most part correct. However, today's forex market lacks the guarantees provided by virtual currencies, such as transparency, verifiability, accessibility, riskless settlement, price discovery,  and the codification of transfer. Combining the two gives the ability to address inefficiencies and limitations within both markets, and will open opportunities to both large institutions as well as retail customers in a way that will enhance the lives of all people.
