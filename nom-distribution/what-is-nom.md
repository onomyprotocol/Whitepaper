## Staking&#x20;

When NOM holders delegate their NOM to a validator, they are _**staking.**_ Staking provides rewards in return for delegating to validators who support the security and operations of a blockchain network.

## Collateral

NOM is the single collateral to Onomy's Denom stablecoins. Upon locking the token into the Onomy Reserve, users may easily mint Denoms pegged to the worldâ€™s major currencies.

### Properties of NOM as Perfect Collateral

* **Malleable:** Ability to mint any denomination of a stabilized virtual currency
* **Scarce:** Predefined release into circulating supply and burning of supply
* **Transferable:** Transactions on the Onomy Network finalize near instantaneously
* **Durable:** Secure decentralized system capable of self-stabilizing from attacks
* **Verifiable:** Anonymous accounts are publicly verifiable on the network
* **Fair:** Transactions are ordered by which arrives at the most nodes first

## Governance&#x20;

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles.

Onomy will be governed by the Onomy DAO**, providing NOM holders with the opportunity to guide the decision-making process through NOM-weighed votes**.&#x20;

## **AMM Keeper Bots**

**NOM** is programmatically purchased and removed from supply by Keeper bots observing AMM liquidity pool rewards from the Onomy Exhange (ONEX). This provides perpetually growing deflationary pressure on **NOM** as exchange volumes grow.
