# What Is NOM?

NOM serves as Onomy Protocol's utility token and is endowed with several use cases. NOM will initially be available through a [Bonding Curve Offering](https://medium.com/onomy-protocol/what-is-a-bonding-curve-offering-bco-12518e0a98fc), with exchange listings planned shortly thereafter.&#x20;

## üèõÔ∏è Collateral

NOM is the single collateral to our Denom stablecoins. Upon locking the token into the Onomy Reserve, users may easily mint Denoms pegged to the world‚Äôs major currencies.

### Properties of NOM as Perfect Collateral

* **Malleable: **Ability to mint any denomination of a stabilized virtual currency
* **Scarce: **Predefined release into circulating supply and burning of supply
* **Transferable: **Transactions on the Onomy Network finalize near instantaneously
* **Durable:** Secure decentralized system capable of self-stabilizing from attacks
* **Verifiable: **Anonymous accounts are publicly verifiable on the network
* **Fair: **Transactions are ordered by which arrives at the most nodes first

Lastly, the Denoms are not only collateralized by NOM, but are also a vessel of collateralization of NOM. As mentioned before, the flows of currencies determine the exchange rate or value of a currency in terms of other currencies. The exchange rate, determined by the currency flows, is then, in essence, the evidence of a form of market collateralization.&#x20;

The ability for a currency to be exchanged for another is what backs fiat currencies not tied to gold as well as volatile cryptocurrencies that have no other underlying collateral. Therefore, if a Denom is stabilized with its counterpart fiat currency, then it becomes collateralized by the market. Thus, the NOM itself is collateralized by the Denoms it can mint. As the Denoms market capitalization grows, whilst being stabilized with their fiat counterparts, the NOM is itself collateralized by the market as well, while serving as the collateral for the market.

## üîí Staking&#x20;

NOM is staked or delegated to validators to assure network-wide security for our native layer-1 Cosmos-based blockchain network, unlocking earnings for those that help secure the network.

The primary network security of the ONET is assured by a Proof of Stake model that bonds NOM to validators either by the validators themselves or through delegation. Network security depends on the bonding to create both incentives for good behavior and disincentives for bad behavior. Staked NOM may not be used to mint new Denoms while staked, but will receive the staking rewards, up to 100% yearly depending on the amount of NOM staked.&#x20;

## üó≥Ô∏è Governance&#x20;

Holding NOM empowers users to initiate and vote on governance proposals within the Onomy Decentralization Autonomous Organization (DAO).

## üìà Revenue&#x20;

The Onomy Exchange, a hybrid AMM/orderbook and cross-chain DEX, will offer incentives to NOM holders who may obtain revenue from exchange fees and bridged liquidity pools.
