# What Is NOM?

NOM is Onomy Protocol's utility token, endowed with the following use cases:&#x20;

#### Collateral&#x20;

NOM is the single collateral to our stablecoins. Upon locking the token into the Onomy Reserve, users may easily mint Denoms pegged to the worldâ€™s major currencies. As collateral, NOM is interoperable, malleable, scarce, transferable, durable, ferifiable, and fair.&#x20;

#### Staking&#x20;

NOM is staked or delegated to validators to assure network-wide security for our native layer-1 Cosmos-based blockchain network.

#### Governance&#x20;

Holding NOM empowers users to initiate and vote on governance proposals within the Onomy Decentralization Autonomous Organization (DAO).

#### Revenue&#x20;

The Onomy Exchange, a hybrid AMM/orderbook and cross-chain DEX, will offer incentives to NOM holders who may obtain revenue from exchange fees and bridged liquidity pools.
