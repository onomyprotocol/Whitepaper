# Abstract

Onomy is a single collateral multi-stable coin protocol for virtual denominations of currencies, named Denoms, to support the foreign currency exchange marketplace. The Onomy protocol coin, abbreviated NOM, collateralizes each virtual currency denomination \(Denom\) minted through the Onomy Reserve \(ORES\). The base layer Onomy Exchange \(ONEX\) facilitates high-speed transactions between Denoms and NOM while also providing secure price discovery for collateral ratios and automated liquidations of ORES accounts. The Onomy Network \(ONET\) is built using a Proof of Stake implementation of an innovative concurrent byzantine consensus mechanism that utilizes rank aggregation to order all transactions fairly without byzantine leaders' interference. Participants secure and govern the ONET by staking and delegating validators with NOM and are rewarded with NOM for doing so. NOM that is not staked with or delegated to validators may be used to mint Denoms through the ORES.
