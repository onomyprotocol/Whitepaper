# Introduction & Important Links

![](<.gitbook/assets/black header.png>)

**Onomy Protocol** represents an innovative Layer-1 ecosystem designed to harmonize the worlds of Forex and decentralized finance. At its core lies the **Onomy Network**, a proof-of-stake blockchain constructed using the highly versatile Cosmos SDK framework, and the **Arc Bridge Hub** affording interoperability with EVM, non-EVM, and IBC chains - all maintained by a distributed network of independent validators located around the globe.

A cornerstone of the Onomy Protocol is its Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, which empowers contributors to actively manage and shape the Onomy ecosystem's features, products, marketing initiatives, and more - referred to as Onomy Improvement Proposals (OIPs) in the community. Proposals that demonstrate the most promise are directly funded from the on-chain treasury, which is managed by all holders of Onomy's native NOM token.

### Onomy Improvement Proposals (OIPs)

Current major OIPs in progress include the [**Onomy Exchange**](onomy-improvement-proposals-oips/onomy-exchange-onex.md) **** (a hybrid orderbook+AMM DEX) and the [**Onomy Reserve**](onomy-improvement-proposals-oips/onomy-reserve-ores.md) (decentralized stablecoin issuance).

You can join Onomy's community social channels to connect with 60,000+ fellow _NOMads_ and view information about the Onomy Ecosystem.

### The NOM Token

The **native coin of Onomy Protocol is NOM.** NOM is used to secure the network through staking, payment for transaction and bridge fees, and for governance in the Onomy DAO. When NOM holders delegate their NOM to a validator, they are _**staking.**_ [Staking provides rewards](validators-staking/nom-staking-rewards.md) in return for supporting the security and operations of a blockchain network.

### Onomy DAO (Governance)

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central governing entity. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles.

Onomy is governed by the Onomy DAO**, providing NOM holders with the opportunity to guide the decision-making process through NOM-weighed votes**. Examples of items the Onomy DAO vote on include Chain Upgrades, Parameter Changes, Funding Proposals, and Resolutions for the direction of community efforts for Onomy ecosystem develop
