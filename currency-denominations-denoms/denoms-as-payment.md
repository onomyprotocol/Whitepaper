# Denoms as Payment

As Denoms became a trusted substitute for their represented fiat currencies, further integration of the virtual with real world will take place. The main thing that the virtual world provides is accessibility and access. Both foreign exchange and virtual currency markets have shown are viral in nature. The flow for virtual currencies between customers then is specifically on the virtual domain. Virtual currencies will begin to overtake their represented fiat counterparts as the preferred form of payment. This due to the interconnected nature, peer 2 peer transactions and verifiable history. At that time, fiat currencies will become more of a collateral than method of payment. Dealers in forex will not only have access to real fiat currencies markets, but be able to convert fiat to virtual and virtual to fiat. Denoms will be minted and traded on Onomy with market sizes of specific Denoms growing and shrinking with the demand for exchange following trade winds. Banks that offer virtual and fiat services will takeover dealer roles and retail aggregators that offer fiat-pairs as well as fiat-fiat pairs will have a significant advantage over their counterparts serving only fiat or virtual. As the Mandalorian would say, “This is the way” to full-scale integration of the virtual with the real.
