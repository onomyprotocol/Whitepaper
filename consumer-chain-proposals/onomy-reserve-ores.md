A global decentralized reserve bank acts as the ultimate trustless agent that could allow for the supranational effects of the actions of central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to be put in the hands of the global crypto economy and unlatched from the nation states that power them. Run by a decentralised organisation that canâ€™t change the systems underpinning the bank at a whim.

Just like Medici bankers that gave out currency across Europe, a global decentralized reserve bank could issue virtual, yet collateralized stablecoins anywhere in the world at any time through a simple web and mobile apps. These stablecoins can then be seamlessly used for simple wealth storage, portfolio diversification, debt settlement, Forex trading, payment, and remittance.&#x20;
